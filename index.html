  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: August 18, 2025</em></p>

  <p><strong>Colorfall</strong> (the “App”) is developed and published by <strong>Ivan Zyablov</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”). 
  We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. 
  This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, your rights, and how you can contact us.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Data You Provide:</strong> If you create an account (optional), we may collect a username, password, or other information you choose to provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> Device type, operating system, advertising ID, app usage data, crash logs, approximate location (not precise GPS).</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Data:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> collects device info, advertising ID, usage data, approximate location to deliver ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Analytics:</strong> collects gameplay session data, device identifiers, level progress, in-app events, and crash data to help us improve performance and user experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the App and its features.</li>
    <li>Display ads via Google AdMob (non-personalized for users under age of consent).</li>
    <li>Analyze gameplay and app performance via Unity Analytics.</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud and ensure security.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, we process data based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> (e.g., personalized ads if you allow it).</li>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong> (providing access to the App).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> (analytics, fraud prevention).</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong> (where applicable).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
  <p><strong>GDPR (EU/UK):</strong> You have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, or transfer your data, and withdraw consent.</p>
  <p><strong>CCPA/CPRA (California, USA):</strong> You have the right to request disclosure, deletion, opt-out of data “sale/sharing” (we do not sell data), and non-discrimination.</p>
  <p>You may also opt out of personalized ads in your device settings (Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt-out of Ads Personalization).</p>
  <p>In the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we use a certified Consent Management Platform (CMP) to comply with GDPR/TCF requirements. 
    You can provide or withdraw your consent at any time through the consent form shown in the App. If you do not give consent, we will serve only non-personalized ads.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS). We use technical and organizational safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the App and meet legal obligations. Data is then securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for users aged <strong>13 and above</strong>strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 (or the local age of digital consent)
  We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 (or the local age of digital consent). 
  For younger users, AdMob is configured with the <em>“Tag for under age of consent”</em> setting, ensuring only non-personalized ads are displayed. 
  If we learn we have inadvertently collected data from a child, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed outside your country of residence. Where required, we rely on safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).</p>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob – <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li>Unity Analytics – <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App itself does not use cookies, but third-party services may use device identifiers or similar technologies for ads and analytics.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted in the App and/or on our website with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
